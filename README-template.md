# Frontend Mentor - Huddle landing page with single introductory section solution

This is a solution to the [Huddle landing page with single introductory section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-a-single-introductory-section-B_2Wvxgi0). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I decided to try out tailwind CSS in this project

### What I learned

I learned that I should spend more time considering how to order the styles that I add because it can
quickly become confusing with long lists of classes in the html.

### Continued development

I will persist in practising tailwind and perhaps grow accustomed to using the apply tags where you can
create standard groups of stylings to declutter the html class lists

### Useful resources
